What is an IEP? # An ISCC Enhancement Proposal (IEP) is a design document providing information to the ISCC community, or describing a new feature for the ISCC or its processes or environment. An IEP should provide a concise technical specification of a feature and a rationale for the feature. IEPs have no special status except that accorded by the community. IEPs are a mechanism for proposing new features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting design decisions. The IEP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions. Because the IEPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal. 2. IEP audience # The typical primary audience for IEPs are the developers of ISCC implementations. However, other parts of the ISCC community may also choose to use the process (particularly for Informational IEPs) to document expected API conventions and to manage complex design coordination problems that require collaboration across multiple projects. 3. IEP workflow # The IEP process begins with a new idea for the ISCC. Each potential IEP must have a champion - someone who writes the IEP using the style and format described below, shepherds the discussions in the appropriate forums, and attempts to build community consensus around the idea. Small enhancements or patches to a particular piece of software often don't require coordination between multiple projects or implementations; these don't need an IEP and should be injected into the relevant project-specific development workflow with a patch submission to the applicable issue tracker. After investigating past work, the best way to proceed is by opening issue for discussion about the new idea. Following a discussion, the proposal should be submitted to the IEPs git repository as a pull request. This draft must be written in IEP style as described below, and named with an alias such as \"iep-johndoe-new-semantic-id\" until an editor has assigned it an IEP number (authors MUST NOT self-assign IEP numbers). When the IEP draft is complete, an IEP editor will assign the IEP a number, label it as Core, Informational, or Process, and merge the pull request to the IEPs git repository. The IEP editors will not unreasonably reject an IEP. Reasons for rejecting IEPs include duplication of effort, disregard for formatting rules, being too unfocused or too broad, being technically unsound, not providing proper motivation or addressing backwards compatibility. For an IEP to be accepted it must meet certain minimum criteria. It must be a clear and complete description of the proposed enhancement. The enhancement must represent a net improvement. The proposed implementation, if applicable, must be solid and must not complicate the protocol unduly. The IEP author may update the draft as necessary in the git repository. Updates to drafts should also be submitted by the author as pull requests. 3.1 Transferring IEP ownership # It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of IEPs to a new champion. A good reason to transfer ownership is because the original author no longer has the time or interest in updating it or following through with the IEP process, or is unreachable or not responding to email. If you are interested in assuming ownership of an IEP, send a message asking to take over, addressed to both the original author and the IEP editors. If the original author doesn't respond to email in a timely manner, the IEP editors will make a unilateral decision. 3.2 IEP editors # The current IEP editors are: Titusz Pan tp@iscc.foundation 3.3 IEP editor responsibilities # The IEP editors subscribe to the IEP issue tracker. Correspondence outside the issue tracker should be sent (or CC'd) to the IEP editors. For each new IEP that comes in an editor does the following: Read the IEP to check if it is ready: sound and complete. The ideas must make technical sense. The title should accurately describe the content. Motivation and backward compatibility (when applicable) must be addressed. Licensing terms must be acceptable for IEPs. If the IEP isn't ready, the editor will send it back to the author for revision, with specific instructions. Once the IEP is ready for the repository it should be submitted as a \"pull request\" to the IEPs git repository where it may get further feedback. The IEP editor will: Assign an IEP number in the pull request. Merge the pull request when it is ready. List the IEP in README.md. The IEP editors are intended to fulfill administrative and editorial responsibilities. The IEP editors monitor IEP changes, and update IEP headers as appropriate. 4. IEP format and structure # IEPs should be written in Markdown format. Each IEP should have the following parts: Preamble - Headers containing metadata about the IEP (see below). Abstract - A short (~200 word) description of the issue being addressed. Motivation - A motivation section is critical for IEPs that want to change pre-existing specifications. It should clearly explain why the existing specification is inadequate to address the problem that the IEP solves. This section may be omitted if the motivation is evident. Specification - The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations. Rationale - The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the community and discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion around the IEP. Backwards compatibility - All IEPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The IEP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. Reference implementation - A reference implementation must be completed before a Core IEP is given status Stable, but it need not be completed before the IEP is accepted. The stable implementation must include test code and documentation. Copyright - The IEP must be explicitly licensed under acceptable copyright terms see below . 4.1 IEP header preamble # Each IEP must begin with a header preamble. The headers must appear in the following order. Headers marked with \"*\" are optional and are described below. All other headers are required. IEP: <IEP number, or \"?\" before being assigned> Title: <IEP title; maximum 44 characters> Author: <list of authors' names and email addresses> Comments: <link to issue page for comments> Status: <Draft | Deferred | Withdrawn | Proposed | Rejected | Stable | Obsolete> Type: <Core | Informational | Process> License: <abbreviation for approved license(s)> Created: <date created on, in ISO 8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format> Updated: <date updated on, in ISO 8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format> * Replaces: <IEP number> * Superseded-By: <IEP number> The Author header lists the names and email addresses of all the authors/owners of the IEP. The format of the Author header value must be Random J. User <address@dom.ain> If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line. The Type header specifies the type of IEP: Core, Informational, or Process. The Created header records the date that the IEP was assigned a number. Dates should be in yyyy-mm-dd format, e.g. 2001-08-14. IEPs may have a Superseded-By header indicating that an IEP has been rendered obsolete by a later document; the value is the number of the IEP that replaces the current document. The newer IEP must have a Replaces header containing the number of the IEP that it rendered obsolete. 5. IEP Types # There are three kinds of IEPs: A Core IEP describes any change that affects most or all ISCC implementations, such as a change to the algorithms for creating ISCCs, or any change or addition that affects the interoperability of applications using the ISCC. Core IEPs consist of two parts, a design document and a reference implementation. An Informational IEP describes an ISCC design issue, or provides general guidelines or information to the ISCC community, but does not propose a new feature. Informational IEPs do not necessarily represent a ISCC community consensus or recommendation, so users and implementors are free to ignore Informational IEPs or follow their advice. A Process IEP describes a process surrounding ISCC, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process IEPs are like Core IEPs but apply to areas other than the ISCC algorithms itself. Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and changes to the tools or environment used in ISCC development. 6. IEP status # The typical paths of the status of IEPs are as follows: flowchart LR B[Draft] B --> C[Poposed] B <--> D[Deferred] B <--> E[Withdrawn] C --> F[Stable] C --> G[Rejected] F --> H[Obsolete] Champions of an IEP may decide on their own to change the status between Draft, Deferred, or Withdrawn. An IEP editor may also change the status to Deferred when no progress is being made on the IEP. An IEP may only change status from Draft to Proposed, when the author deems it is complete, has a working implementation (where applicable), and has community plans to progress it to the Stable status. IEPs should be changed from Draft or Proposed status, to Rejected status, upon request by any person, if they have not made progress in three years. Such an IEP may be changed to Draft status if the champion provides revisions that meaningfully address public criticism of the proposal, or to Proposed status if it meets the criteria required as described in the previous paragraph. An IEP may change status from Draft to Stable when it achieves rough consensus on the issue tracker and sufficient real-world adoption. Such a proposal is said to have rough consensus if it has been open to discussion on the issue tracker for at least one month, and no person maintains any unaddressed substantiated objections to it. Addressed or obstructive objections may be ignored/overruled by general agreement that they have been sufficiently addressed, but clear reasoning must be given in such circumstances. Software authors are encouraged to publish summaries of what IEPs their software supports to aid in verification of status changes. Should an IEP become actually and unambiguously adopted despite not meeting the criteria outlined here, it should still be updated to Stable status. When a Stable IEP is no longer relevant, its status may be changed to Obsolete. This change must also be objectively verifiable and/or discussed. 7. IEP licensing # New IEPs may be accepted with the following licenses. Each new IEP must identify at least one acceptable license in its preamble. The License header in the preamble must be placed befor the Created header. Each license must be referenced by their respective abbreviation given below. IEPs are not required to be exclusively licensed under approved terms, and may also be licensed under unacceptable licenses in addition to at least one acceptable license. In this case, only the acceptable license(s) should be listed in the License header. 7.1 Acceptable licenses # BSD-2-Clause: OSI-approved BSD 2-clause license BSD-3-Clause: OSI-approved BSD 3-clause license CC0-1.0: Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal Apache-2.0: Apache License, version 2.0 CC-BY-4.0: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International CC-BY-SA-4.0: Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International MIT: Expat/MIT/X11 license 8.

The final version is developed at the International Organization for Standardization as ISO /AWI 24138 1. Abstract # This document describes the coding scheme for the International Standard Content Code (ISCC). 2. Motivation # The ISCC is a similarity preserving identifier for all kinds of digital content. As such the ISCC requires a universal coding scheme to meet a broad set of use cases and support different media types. The coding scheme for all ISCCs should be: compact interoperable modular extensible self-describing 3. General structure of ISCC # An ISCC shall be composed of an ISCC-HEADER and an ISCC-BODY. The ISCC-HEADER shall describe the MainType, SubType, Version, and Length of its ISCC-BODY. An ISCC-UNIT shall be an ISCC based on one specific algorithm. An ISCC-CODE shall be an ISCC composed of two or more different ISCC-UNITs. Figure 1 - General Structure of an ISCC 4. ISCC-HEADER # The ISCC-HEADER is a variable sized bitstream composed of an ordered sequence of the 4 header-fields MainType, SubType, Version, Length. Each header-field is a bitstream with a length between 4 and 16 bits and encodes an integer value between 0 and 4679 with the following encoding scheme: The total bit-length of a header-field shall be determined by its prefix-bits. The prefix-bits shall be followed by data-bits. The data-bits shall be interpreted as unsigned integer values plus the maximum value of the preceding range. If the total length of all header-fields in number of bits is not divisible by 8, the header shall be padded with 4 zero bits (0000) on the right side. Table 1 \u2013 Variable length ISCC-HEADER field encoding Prefix bits Number of nibbles Number of data bits Integer range 0 1 3 0-7 10 2 6 8-71 110 3 9 72-583 1110 4 12 584-4679 Header-field examples 0 = 0000 1 = 0001 \u2026 7 = 0111 8 = 1000 0000 9 = 1000 0001 The interpretation of the integer value of a header-field shall be context dependent: For the MainType and SubType fields it shall be an identifier for the designated type. For the Version field it shall be the literal version number. For the Length field of ISCC-UNITs it shall be a number used as a multiplier to calculate the bit length of the ISCC-BODY. For the Length field of ISCC-CODEs it shall be a bit-pattern encoding the combination of ISCC-UNITs and the bit-length of the ISCC-BODY. 4.1 MainTypes # The MainType header-field shall signify the type of the ISCC. Backward incompatible updates to an algorithm associated with a MainType shall be indicated by incrementing the version field of the ISCC-HEADER of the respective MainType. Note The first edition of the standard specifies initial algorithms (version 0) for all reserved MainTypes except for the SEMANTIC type which is not currently defined.

Status of This Document # This document is a draft of a potential specification. It has no official standing of any kind and does not represent the support or consensus of any standards organization. 2. Introduction # The purpose of a decentralized content registry is to connect Actors to Digital Content in a permissionless decentralized environment and provide a global and verifiable data space for content identification and matching. Actors authenticate themselves with their blockchain accounts which they use to sign ISCC-CODE declarations (ledger transactions). Digital Content is identified by ISCC-CODEs. The ISCC-ID is derived from an ISCC-CODE, a blockchain account and the history of previous declarations. ISCC-IDs are globally unique, persistent, authenticated, and resolve to at least exactly one ISCC-CODE and a blockchain account. The ISCC-IDs are not required to be generated or stored on the participating ledgers. ISCC-IDs are the result of processing the history of transactions according to the Minting Protocol. 3. Protocol Overview # The protocol to declare an ISCC-CODE and trigger the minting of an ISCC-ID is divided into 3 parts, the Declaration Protocol, the Minting Protocol and the Resolution Protocol. The declaration protocol defines how an ISCC-CODE has to be written to a ledger to become a valid input for the off-chain minting protocol. The minting protocol defines how a legers history has to be parsed to mint a valid ISCC-ID The resolution protocol defines how an ISCC resolver answers queries about ISCC-CODEs and ISCC-ID. 4. Declaration Protocol # To participate in the ISCC declaration protocol, a ledger MUST establish exactly one globally unique Ledger-ID (Variable Length Integer) that will be used as a prefix for ISCC-IDs that are minted from its ISCC declarations. Note An ISCC-ID comes into existence only after an ISCC declaration has been confirmed on a ledger that participates in the protocol. The following minimal information (Declaration-Set) MUST be provided and made publicly available for a valid ISCC declaration: An ISCC-CODE (a valid sequence of ISCC-UNITs) A blockchain account (actors identifier) of the declaring party A valid signature of the declaring party (transaction signature) We define the party that signs the ISCC declaration as the DECLARER. Note The DECLARER is merely the controller of the ISCC-ID minted from the declaration. The declarer is not required to be the creator or a rights-holder of the declared digital content. An ISCC declaration MAY additionally include: A link to external metadata as defined by IEP-0012 - ISCC Metadata A processing instruction for the minting protocol The on-chain link to ISCC metadata SHOULD point to a public and integrity preserving resource (e.g. IPFS CID or a hashlink URI). Permissioned, confidential or mutable data SHOULD be referenced from ISCC metadata via URI. A ledger that wants to accept ISCC declarations and trigger the minting of valid ISCC-IDs MUST fulfill the following minimum requirements: The ledger must provide an immutable, complete, time-ordered, append-only sequence of transactions. The legers transaction format must allow for embedding and signing the data required for an ISCC declarations. The Declaration-Set MUST be publicly readable (permisionless). ISCC declarations on the ledger MAY be write-permissioned. A participating ledger or framework MUST provide documentaation of its implementation of the declaration protocol. The documentation MUST specify how ISCC declarations can be parsed to decode the Declaration-Set The documentation MUST provide sufficient information to the public such that third parties can independently verify transactions signatures and implement the Minting Protocol The documentation MUST define how a public observer can distinguish between a transaction that declares an ISCC-CODE and other unrelated transactions. 5.

Status of This Document This document is a draft of a potential specification. It has no official standing of any kind and does not represent the support or consensus of any standards organization. 1. Introduction # 1.1 Preface # The ISCC DID method specification conforms to the requirements specified in the Decentralized Identifiers v1.0 Specification DID-CORE . 1.2 Motivation # The need for a universal identifier for digital content has emerged as an increasing amount of dynamic, short-lived and granular digital content is produced, consumed and processed. Commercial interests of many stakeholders depend on proper identification of digital content. Professionally produced digital content but also semi-professional and user-generated content are the currency of the information age. A variety of specific content identifier standards already exist, but a universal content-dependent identifier for digital media has not yet been developed. In particular, the structure and management of identifiers for digital content have a substantial impact on the level of possible adoption, automation, and the potential for machine-to-machine communication and innovation within and across different industry sectors. Digital content is dynamic, always in motion, and acted upon globally by a variety of entities with different interests and requirements. Digital content continuously re-encodes, resizes, and re-compresses, changing its underlying data as it travels through a complex network of actors and systems. These circumstances require a special design for a universal identifier that is capable of matching transcoded or otherwise transformed content. 1.3 The ISCC # The ISCC (International Standard Content Code) is a universal and open identification system for text, audio, image, and video based content. ISCC-CODEs can be created from media assets by anybody using open source software. Similar content can then be matched by comparing ISCC-CODEs only. Example ISCC-CODE ISCC:KECYCPU3OKIUDZ7TYBRK5HZ4JGPTILLAT2IW7TY7EYIJI4QSK5I353I Decoded: ISCC-IMAGE-V0-MCDI-813e9b729141e7f3c062ae9f3c499f342d609e916fcf1f26109472125751beed Users can also register ISCC-CODEs on any supported public blockchain to obtain a short and globaly unique ISCC-ID. The ISCC-ID is under the control of the registrant and resolves to an ISCC-CODE, on-chain metadata and optional off-chain metadata. ISCC-IDs are globaly unique even if the same ISCC-CODE is registered multiple times by different entities. An ISCC-ID is minted deterministically by observing participating legers and can be reproduced by anybody who observes the public and immutable registration events. Example ISCC-ID ISCC:MIAGWPTV4J2Z57CI Decoded: ID-ETHEREUM-V0-64-6b3e75e2759efc48 1.4 ISCC-ID as DID # The ISCC DID method creates a mechanism to reference digital content with a globaly unique persistent identifier that does not require a centralized registration authority. Instead, the ISCC system defines an open and voluntary cross-chain registration protocol using cryptography and distributed ledger technology. Integrating ISCC with the DID system improves ISCC interoperability. DID documents provide standardized ways to discover services related to the referenced content and its registrant. Verifiable credentials discovered through the DID document service property can improve trust in otherwise permissionless content registrations. Additionaly the use of decentralized web nodes allow for interoperable discovery and data sovereignity of hosted verifiable credentials. At the same time ISCC would bring open content identification to the Decentalized Identifiers ecosystem. 2. Method Syntax # 2.1 Method Name # The name that shall identify this DID method is: iscc . A DID that uses this method MUST begin with the following prefix: did:iscc: . According to the DID specification, this string MUST be in lowercase. 2.2 Method Specific Identifier # The ISCC DID scheme conforms to the DID Syntax and is defined by the follwing ABNF : ISCC DID scheme ABNF iscc-did = \"did:iscc:\" iscc iscc = 10*88 ( numbers / letters ) numbers = %x32-37 ; 2-7 letters = %x61-7A ; a-z The data structure of the ISCC is <MainType><SubType><Version><Length><ISCC-BODY> The method specific identifier is a lower-cased base32 representation of the ISCC structure . The regular expression for this DID method is ^did:iscc:[2-7a-z]{10,88}$ 2.3 ISCC DID Example # DID representation of an ISCC-ID did:iscc:miagwptv4j2z57ci 3. Method Operations # 3.1 Creation # An ISCC DID MUST be created by a signed and confirmed ledger transaction that declares an ISCC-CODE in accordance with the cross-chain declaration protocol . The initial controller of a newly created ISCC DID MUST be the did:pkh representation of the blockchain account that signed the declaration transaction. The controller MAY set a custom DID Document at declaration time by embedding or referencing it from ISCC Metadata 3.2 Read # A basic DID document is implicitly created with every ISCC declaration and MUST be deterministicaly derived from on-chain metadata. Extended DID document properties MAY be imported from externaly referenced ISCC Metadata 3.3 Update & Deactivate # The ISCC DID MAY be updated or deactivated in accordence with the chain specific implementation of the ISCC declaration protocol. 4. Verifiable Data Registry # The verifiable data registry or \"target system\" for ISCC DIDs is a federation of existing public ledgers that support the ISCC declaration protocol. The protocol can be implemented on most public ledgers (even without smart contracts) that provide an orderd, immutable, append-only history of signed transactions. Figure 1 - ISCC Verifiable Data Registry 5. DID Document # DID documents are sourced from on-chain metadata and optionally from immutably or mutably referenced off-chain metadata. All information required to construct a minimal valid DID document from an ISCC declaration is available on-chain and can be dynamically transformed and presented as DID document by a DID driver implementation. Minimal ISCC DID Document example { \"@context\" : \"https://www.w3id.org/ns/did/v1\" \"id\" : \"did:iscc:miagwptv4j2z57ci\" , \"controller\" : \"did:pkh:eip155:1:0x901ee44e3bddf4bc1c08a2ed229498512f8bcfdc\" , \"alsoKnownAs\" : \"iscc:kecycpu3okiudz7tybrk5hz4jgptillat2iw7ty7eyiji4qsk5i353i\" , \"service\" : [{ \"id\" : \"did:iscc:miagwptv4j2z57ci#iscc-metadata\" , \"type\" : \"IsccMetadata\" , \"serviceEndpoint\" : \"ipfs://bafybeiccys7kilr3rynlhoelrdn6ragpbfoti73h4e3oszbgd5inthicja/iscc-metadata/43.json\" }] } The DID subject ( id -property) MUST be the ISCC-ID in DID representation. The DID controller ( controller -property) MUST be constructed deterministically by converting the blockchain account that signed the declaration transaction to a did:pkh . The alsoKnownAs -property MUST be set to the ISCC-CODE registered by the transaction. If the original ISCC declaration includes a link to off-chain metadata the DID document MUST include the reference via an entry into the service -property with type \"IsccMetadata\". The referenced serviceEndpoint SHOULD return a document of type http://purl.org/iscc/context . Info Properties like verificationMethod , authentication , assertionMethod etc. are left out intentionally, as their autoritative values are managed by the DID document associated with the controler that can be resolved separately. To be defined Additional/Optional DID document data MAY be added off-chain in mutable or immutable modes and retrived and incjected by the DID driver in realtime to compose an extended DID document that includes other properties like service . 6. Resolving DIDs # An ISCC DID can be resolved by querying an instantiation of an ISCC content registry . The authenticity of the response can be verified through the referenced on-chain transaction. Figure 2 - ISCC DID Architecture 7. Security Considerations # Implementers should be aware that ISCC-CODEs are not cryptographic hashes but descriptors or similarity preserving (soft) hashes. As such they leak information about the structure of the identified content. This is by design and necessary to support similarity matching with ISCC-CODEs. An ISCC DID document does not need to contain a proof property. All operations are authenticated with the signature of the transaction payload sent to the network of the originating ledger. This signature is generated using a key specified in the corresponding DID Document. 8. Privacy Considerations # ISCC declarations do not publish any personal data on-chain. Declarers may optionally reference off-chain metadata related to their content registration. Such metadata may contain personal data such as creator and rightsholder information. The assumption is that creators have an interest in proper attribution. Applications that implement ISCC declarations are advised to inform users about any privacy related matters specific to their application. 9.
