!!! note

    This document is a **DRAFT** contributed as input to 
    [ISO TC 46/SC 9/WG 18](https://www.iso.org/committee/48836.html). The final version is 
    published under [ISO 24138:2024](https://www.iso.org/standard/77899.html).

## General

1. The Content-Code Subtype Mixed (Mixed-Code) shall be a similarity preserving hash of a collection of assets of the same or different media types combined into a single multimedia file.
2. An ISCC processor that supports the creation of Mixed-Codes shall publicly document the supported file formats and the rules by which it divides the different parts of a multimedia file.
3. The Mixed-Code shall be robust against format conversions, scaling, compression, and minor edits of the individual parts of the multimedia file.

## Format

The Mixed-Code shall have the data format illustrated in Figure 9:

!!! example "EXAMPLE 2: 256-bit Mixed-Code in its canonical form:"

    ISCC:EQDSD57JXX7U73P7HPPH2P3U5OXZM7PL65T3HZ5JZ76H577P77NO5ZY

## Inputs

1. The input for calculating the Mixed-Code shall be the Content-Codes of the individual parts of the multimedia file.
2. At least two Content-Codes shall be required as input to calculate a Mixed-Code.

## Outputs

Mixed-Code processing shall generate the following ISCC metadata output elements:

1. iscc: the Mixed-Code in its canonical form (required);
2. parts: the list of Contentâ€“Codes used for calculating the Mixed-Code (recommended);
3. Additional metadata extracted from the multimedia file (optional).

## Processing

An ISCC processor shall pre-process the multimedia file as follows:

1. Generate individual Content-Codes for each part of the multimedia file according to the 
   specifications in [IEP-0003](iep-0003.md), [IEP-0004](iep-0004.md), [IEP-0005](iep-0005.md) and 
   [IEP-0006](iep-0006.md).

An ISCC processor shall calculate the Mixed-Code as follows:

1. Create a byte sequence from each Content-Code retaining the first byte of the ISCC-HEADER concatenated with the bytes of the ISCC-BODY.
2. Apply the similarity hash to the list of byte sequences from step 1 to calculate the ISCC-BODY of the Mixed-Code.

## Conformance

The normative behaviour of an ISCC processor in generating a Mixed Code is specified only for 
Content-Code inputs. An implementation of the Mixed-Code algorithm shall be regarded as conforming 
to the standard if it creates the same Mixed-Code as the reference implementation for the same 
Content-Code inputs.
