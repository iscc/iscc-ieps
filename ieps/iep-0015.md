**Abstract**

A DID method that identifies decentralized declarations of digital content using ISCC-IDs.

**Status of This Document**

This document is a draft of a potential specification. It has no official standing of any kind and
does not represent the support or consensus of any standards organization.

## Introduction

### Preface

The ISCC DID method specification conforms to the requirements specified in the Decentralized
Identifiers v1.0 Specification [DID-CORE](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/).

### Motivation

The need for a universal identifier for digital content has emerged as an increasing amount of
dynamic, short-lived and granular digital content is produced, consumed and processed. Commercial
interests of many stakeholders depend on proper identification of digital content.

Professionally produced digital content but also semi-professional and user-generated content are
the currency of the information age. A variety of specific content identifier standards already 
exist, but a universal content-dependent identifier for digital media has not yet been developed.

In particular, the structure and management of identifiers for digital content have a substantial
impact on the level of possible adoption, automation, and the potential for machine-to-machine 
communication and innovation within and across different industry sectors.

Digital content is dynamic, always in motion, and acted upon globally by a variety of entities with 
different interests and requirements. Digital content continuously re-encodes, resizes, and 
re-compresses, changing its underlying data as it travels through a complex network of actors and 
systems. These circumstances require a special design for a universal identifier that is capable
of matching transcoded or otherwise transformed content.

### The ISCC 

The ISCC (International Standard Content Code) is a universal and open identification system for
text, audio, image, and video content. ISCC-CODEs can be created from media assets by anybody
using open source software. Similar content can then be matched by comparing ISCC-CODEs only.

!!! example "Example ISCC-CODE"
    ```
    ISCC:KECYCPU3OKIUDZ7TYBRK5HZ4JGPTILLAT2IW7TY7EYIJI4QSK5I353I
    Decoded: ISCC-IMAGE-V0-MCDI-813e9b729141e7f3c062ae9f3c499f342d609e916fcf1f26109472125751beed
    ```

Users can also register ISCC-CODEs on any supported public blockchain to obtain a short and globaly
unique ISCC-ID. The ISCC-ID is under the control of the registrant and resolves to an ISCC-CODE, 
on-chain metadata and optional off-chain metadata. ISCC-IDs are globaly unique even if the same
ISCC-CODE is registered multiple times by different entities. An ISCC-ID is minted 
deterministically by observing participating legers and can be reproduced by anybody who observes 
the public and immutable registration events.

!!! example "Example ISCC-ID"
    ```
    ISCC:MIAGWPTV4J2Z57CI
    Decoded: ID-ETHEREUM-V0-64-6b3e75e2759efc48
    ```

### ISCC-ID as DID

The ISCC DID method creates a mechanism to reference digital content with a globaly unique
persistent identifier that does not require a centralized registration authority. Instead, the
ISCC system defines an open and voluntary cross-chain registration protocol using cryptography and
distributed ledger technology.

Integrating ISCC with the DID system improves ISCC interoperability. DID documents provide
standardized ways to discover [services](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#services) related to the
referenced content and its registrant.

[Verifiable credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) discovered through the DID document 
`service` property can improve trust in otherwise permissionless content registrations. Additionaly
the use of [decentralized web nodes](https://identity.foundation/decentralized-web-node/spec/) allow
for interoperable discovery and data sovereignity of hosted verifiable credentials.

At the same time ISCC would bring open content identification to the *Decentalized Identifiers* 
ecosystem.

## Method Syntax

### Method Name

1. The name that shall identify this DID method is: `iscc`.
2. A DID that uses this method MUST begin with the following prefix: `did:iscc:`.
3. According to the DID specification, this string MUST be in lowercase.

### Method Specific Identifier

The ISCC DID scheme conforms to the [DID Syntax](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#did-syntax) and is
defined by the follwing [ABNF](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/std68):

!!! example "ISCC DID scheme ABNF"

    ```abnf
    iscc-did = "did:iscc:" iscc
    iscc     = 10*88(numbers / letters)
    numbers  = %x32-37  ; 2-7
    letters  = %x61-7A  ; a-z
    ```

1. The data structure of the ISCC is `<MainType><SubType><Version><Length><ISCC-BODY>`
2. The method specific identifier is a lower-cased base32 representation of the [ISCC structure](/iep-0001).
3. The regular expression for this DID method is `^did:iscc:[2-7a-z]{10,88}$`

### ISCC DID Example

!!! example "DID representation of an ISCC-ID"
    ```
    did:iscc:miagwptv4j2z57ci
    ```

## Method Operations

### Creation

1. An ISCC DID MUST be created by a signed and confirmed ledger transaction that declares an
   ISCC-CODE in  accordance with the [cross-chain declaration protocol](/iep-0013).
2. The initial controller of a newly created ISCC DID MUST be the 
   [did:pkh](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-pkh/blob/main/did-pkh-method-draft.md) representation of
   the blockchain account that signed the declaration transaction.
3. The controller MAY set a custom DID Document at declaration time by embedding or referencing it
   from [ISCC Metadata](https://schema.iscc.codes)

### Read

1. A basic DID document is implicitly created with every ISCC declaration and MUST be 
   deterministicaly derived from on-chain metadata.
2. Extended DID document properties MAY be imported from externaly referenced ISCC Metadata


### Update & Deactivate

The ISCC DID MAY be updated or deactivated in accordence with the chain specific implementation of
the ISCC declaration protocol.

## Verifiable Data Registry

The [verifiable data registry](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#architecture-overview) or
"target system" for ISCC DIDs is a federation of existing public ledgers that support the 
ISCC declaration protocol. The protocol can be implemented on most public ledgers (even without smart 
contracts) that provide an orderd, immutable, append-only history of signed transactions.

## DID Document

DID documents are sourced from on-chain metadata and optionally from immutably or mutably
referenced off-chain metadata. 

All information required to construct a minimal valid DID document from an ISCC declaration is
available on-chain and can be dynamically transformed and presented as DID document by a DID 
driver implementation.

!!! example "Minimal ISCC DID Document example"

    ```json
    {
      "@context": "https://www.w3id.org/ns/did/v1"
      "id": "did:iscc:miagwptv4j2z57ci",
      "controller": "did:pkh:eip155:1:0x901ee44e3bddf4bc1c08a2ed229498512f8bcfdc",
      "alsoKnownAs": "iscc:kecycpu3okiudz7tybrk5hz4jgptillat2iw7ty7eyiji4qsk5i353i",
      "service": [{
        "id":"did:iscc:miagwptv4j2z57ci#iscc-metadata",
        "type": "IsccMetadata", 
        "serviceEndpoint": "ipfs://bafybeiccys7kilr3rynlhoelrdn6ragpbfoti73h4e3oszbgd5inthicja/iscc-metadata/43.json"
      }]
    }
    ```

1. The DID subject (`id`-property) MUST be the ISCC-ID in DID representation.
2. The DID controller (`controller`-property) MUST be constructed deterministically by converting
  the blockchain account that signed the declaration transaction to a [`did:pkh`](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-pkh/blob/main/did-pkh-method-draft.md).
3. The `alsoKnownAs`-property MUST be set to the ISCC-CODE registered by the transaction.
4. If the original ISCC declaration includes a link to off-chain metadata the DID document MUST
  include the reference via an entry into the `service`-property with type "IsccMetadata". The 
  referenced `serviceEndpoint` SHOULD return a document of type http://purl.org/iscc/context.

!!! info
    Properties like `verificationMethod`, `authentication`, `assertionMethod` etc. are left out 
    intentionally, as their autoritative values are managed by the DID document associated with
    the `controller` that can be resolved separately.
   
!!! error "To be defined"
    Additional/Optional DID document data MAY be added off-chain in mutable or immutable modes and
    retrived and incjected by the DID driver in realtime to compose an extended DID document that
    includes other properties like `service`.

## Resolving DIDs

1. An ISCC DID can be resolved by querying an instantiation of an [ISCC content registry](https://github.com/iscc/iscc-registry).
2. The authenticity of the response can be verified through the referenced on-chain transaction.

## Security Considerations

Implementers should be aware that ISCC-CODEs are not cryptographic hashes but descriptors or 
similarity preserving (soft) hashes. As such they leak information about the structure of the
identified content. This is by design and necessary to support similarity matching with ISCC-CODEs.

An ISCC DID document does not need to contain a proof property. All operations are authenticated
with the signature of the transaction payload sent to the network of the originating ledger. 
This signature is generated using a key specified in the corresponding DID Document.

## Privacy Considerations

ISCC declarations do not publish any personal data on-chain. Declarers may optionally reference
off-chain metadata related to their content registration. Such metadata may contain personal data
such as creator and rightsholder information. The assumption is that creators have an interest in
proper attribution. Applications that implement ISCC declarations are advised to inform users about
any privacy related matters specific to their application.
