# ISCC - Enhancement Proposals (IEPs)

## What is an IEP?

IEP stands for ISCC Enhancement Proposal. An IEP is a design document providing information to the
ISCC community, or describing a new feature for the ISCC or its processes or environment.

IEPs are a mechanism for proposing new features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for
documenting design decisions. The IEP author is responsible for building consensus within the
community and documenting dissenting opinions.

Because the IEPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is
the historical record of the feature proposal.
